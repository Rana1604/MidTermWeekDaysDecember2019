Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. Use of appropriate data structure enables a computer system to perform its task more efficiently,
    by influencing the ability of computer to store and retrieve data from any location in its memory

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A. The possible operations on the linear data structure are: Traversal, Insertion, Deletion, Searching, Sorting and Merging.
    Examples of Linear Data Structure are Stack and Queue. Stack: Stack is a data structure in which
    insertion and deletion operations are performed at one end only.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. Compiler Design,
   Operating System,
   Database Management System,
   Statistical analysis package,
   Numerical Analysis,
   Graphics,
   Artificial Intelligence,
   and Simulation.

what is an Array?
A. An array is a collection of homogeneous (same type) data items stored in contiguous memory locations

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A. in Java is that Array is a fixed length data structure while ArrayList is a variable length Collection class.
    You can not store primitives in ArrayList, it can only contain Objects.
    While Array can contain both primitives and Objects in Java.

what is LinkedList?
A. Similar to arrays in Java, LinkedList is a linear data structure.
    However LinkedList elements are not stored in contiguous locations like arrays,
    they are linked with each other using pointers. Each element of the LinkedList has the reference(address/pointer)
    to the next element of the LinkedList.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
A. The major difference between Array and Linked list regards to their structure.
    Arrays are index based data structure where each element associated with an index.
    On the other hand, Linked list relies on references where each node consists of the data and the references
    to the previous and next element.

what is queue?
A. Java Queue is a collection of ordered elements (Or objects) but it performs insert and remove operations differently.
    We can use Queue to store elements before processing those elements.

what is stack?
A. Stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.
    stack is a limited access data structure - elements can be added and removed from the stack only at the top.
     push adds an item to the top of the stack, pop removes the item from the top.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
A. LIFO (last-in-first-out) and FIFO (first-in-first-out)

what is the order of complexity?
A. This means that it is a certain mathematical expression of the size of the input,
    and the algorithm finishes between two factors of it. Generally, the smaller the order of complexity of the program's
     underlying algorithm, the faster it will run and the better it will scale as the input gets larger.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
A. Linear Search
   Binary Search

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A. The worst case arises when the element is at last position or not in the array

what is tree in data structure?
A. tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures.
   tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the root and zero or one or more subtrees.

what is graph in data structure?
A.A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and
    the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. ... A Graph consists of a finite set of vertices(or nodes)
     and set of Edges which connect a pair of nodes.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A. Hashtable is synchronized, whereas HashMap is not. This makes HashMap better for non-threaded applications,
    as unsynchronized Objects typically perform better than synchronized ones. Hashtable does not allow null keys or values.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
A. RDBMS = Array (i.e. Array of structures)
   Network data model = Graph
   Hierarchical data model = Trees

How HashMap works in java?
A. HashMap internally stores mapping in the form of Map. Entry object which contains both key and value object.
    When you want to retrieve the object, you call the get() method and again pass the key object.
    ``
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
A. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown to indicate that we are trying to access array element with an illegal index.
    This exception is thrown when the index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
A. Using variable assignment. This method has side effects as changes to the element of an array reflects on both the places. ...
   Create a new array of the same length and copy each element.
   Use the clone method of the array. ...
   Use System.

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
A. Array is a collection of elements of similar data type.
    Linked List is an ordered collection of elements of same type, which are connected to each other using pointers.
     Array supports Random Access, which means elements can be accessed directly using their index,
      like arr[0] for 1st element, arr[6] for 7th element etc.

What is DFS and BFS?
A. DFS stands for Depth First Search. BFS(Breadth First Search) uses Queue data structure for finding the shortest path.
   BFS can be used to find single source shortest path in an unweighted graph, because in BFS,
   we reach a vertex with minimum number of edges from a source vertex.

What is Recursion?
A. Recursion is a basic programming technique you can use in Java, in which a method calls itself to solve some problem.
    A method that uses this technique is recursive. Many programming problems can be solved only by recursion,
     and some problems that can be solved by other techniques are better solved by recursion.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
A. linear data structures arrange data in a sequential manner
    while nonlinear data structures arrange data in a hierarchical manner, creating a relationship among the data elements.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
A. Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument
    tends towards a particular value or infinity. ... Big O notation characterizes functions according to their growth rates.
     different functions with the same growth rate may be represented using the same O notation.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
A. Practical general sorting algorithms are almost always based on an algorithm with average time complexity
    (and generally worst-case complexity) O(n log n), of which the most common are heap sort, merge sort, and quicksort.
    Finally, they may also be unstable, and stability is often a desirable property in a sort.


Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
